Definitions: 
- **Confidentiality:** Prevent unauthorised disclosure of information.
- **Integrity:** Prevent unauthorised modification of informaton.
- **Availability:** Ensuring resources are accessibe when required by an authorised user. 
- **Entity Authentication:** Process by which one entity is assured of the identity of a secound entity.
- **Non-repudiation:** Proof of the origin, authenticity and integrity of the data. 
- **Group generator:** An element of a group that through repeated application of the group operation, can generate the entire group.  
- **Finite field:** A group with addition and multiplication, and with prop. *Finite cadinality*, and *Characteristic*.
- **symmetric and asymmetric ciphers:** Symmetric ciphers uses the same key for encryption and decryption, while asymmetric used two keys, one for each operation.  
- **Ciphertext only attack:** Attacker have access to only a set of ciphertexts, that is, no information about the plaintext generating the cipherstexts. 
- **Known plaintext attack:** Attacker has info about ciphertext and the plaintext generating them. 
- **Chosen plaintext attack:** Attacker knows some the ciphertext of his own chosen plaintexts. 
- **Chosen ciphertext attack:** Attacker can take arbitrary ciphertexts, and find the corresponding plaintext. 
- **Kerckhoffs principle:** Security of the cryptosystem myst lie in the choice of its keys only, everything else should be considered public knowledge. 
- **Passive attacks:** Attack that attempts to learn/make use of, the information from a system. Examples: **Release of message**, **Traffic analysis**.
- **Active attacks:** Attack that attempts to alter system resources / affect their operation. Examples: **Replay, Data modification, Masquerade, Denial of service**
