[*] '/mnt/c/Users/haako/CTF/PICO/chall'
    Arch:       amd64-64-little
    RELRO:      Partial RELRO
    Stack:      No canary found
    NX:         NX enabled
    PIE:        PIE enabled
    Stripped:   No
    Debuginfo:  Yes
```

- RELRO: Relocation read only - Partial: The .got.plt section is still writeable 
- Stack canary: Values placed between the local variables and the control data on the stack which can detect buffer overflow. When enabled: a bufferoverflow will overwrite the canary, and detect the malicious code. IN THIS CASE NOT ENABLED. 
- NX: Makes certain regions of memory non-executable, preventing shellcode injection. In this case, **the stack is non-executable.**
- PIE (Position independent executable): Program can be loaded at random memory addresses each time it is executed. **ENABLED**. -> Need to calculate the offset if we find a memory leak? 
- Stripped: Variable names, comments etc. in this case not enabled. 
- Debuginfo: Easier to debug, variable names, source code line numbers etc. 



From source code:
- use of scanf() can be buffer overflow exploited
