### Polynomial interpolation 
**Use cases:**
- We want to approximate functions over some bounded interval. Say we are given some points, and we want to know a value in between each points, we can use interpolation to estimate the value in this point. 

**Properties and factors to consider:**
- Method: How to compute the polynomials?
- Existence and uniqueness of results: **For Lagrange interpolation, yes to both!** 
- Error Analysis: How good is our approximation?
- Improvements

#### Python implementation:
Should make functions:
- Cardinal(): For generating the cardinal functions 
- Lagrange(): For constructing the polynomial based on the cardinal functions  

#### Properties:
**Existence and uniqueness:**

- Key factor to check when asked if there exist a unique solution: ARE THERE DISTINCT X VALUES? 


##### Error theory:
The relevant question to ask:
![[Pasted image 20250424121401.png]]

We have a formula for finding the error between the polynomial and the function:

- Note: What is 'e' and how do we find it?

**Chebyshev Interpolation:**
- TODO 

Error depend on:
- The number of points
- Distribution of points:![[Pasted image 20250424123702.png]]
- Smoothness of the function we are approximating. 

Other things:
- Uniformly spaced nodes **can** lead to large interpolation errors near the boundaries (Rungeâ€™s phenomenon).


### Numerical Integration - Interpolatory Quadrature Rules 
Problem: How do we solve definite integrals that are really complicated? It is hopeless with calculus. 

Solution: Numerical quadrature or quadrature rules:

Q: Strengths and weaknesses of the methods? 

#### Quadrature rules based on polynomial interpolation:
Idea: Choose some distinct points from the f on a given interval. Approximate the function with a polynomial based on the points. Now we have polynomial which is easier to integrate. (We tend to use the Lagrange interpolation).

NOTE: We can construct Lagrange-versions of the known-classic quadratic rules.
-> Q: Why would do we do this? What improves? 

#### Properties of the method:
**Exactness:**

**Estimates for the quadrature error:**
Q: What is the difference between exactness and error in this context?

General formula for estimating error:

Specific formula for estimating error on concrete methods:
**Trapezoidal rule:**

**Simpsons rule:**
![[Pasted image 20250424132311.png]]

**Ways to increase the accuracy of quadrature rules:**
- Increase the order of the interpolation polynomial used to construct the quadrature rule
- Subdivide the interval we are working with into smaller subintervals and apply a quadrature rule on each of the subintervals -> **Composite quadrature rules.**

**Composite trapezoidal rule:**

- Note: For the Comp-Trap-rule we have that a doubling of the number of subintervals, decrease the error by a forth!
