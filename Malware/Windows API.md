Lingo: 
- **Hook:** A way to intercept ad process certain types of events or messages before they reach their intended destination. Think of it as a checkpoint where you can inspect or modify what happens next.
- **Handle:** Unique identifier / reference to a system resource. Think of it as a ticket use can use to check out a particular resource. 
-  **Calling convention:** 
- **DLL:**

Datatypes:
- LPCWSTR (Long pointer to constant wide string): Example used to the path of a .exe file. Think of the datatype as a pointer to a constant wide-character string(wchar_t). Note: Find the correct .exe file you want to open, **do not** confuse with the SHORTCUT to the .exe.
- STARTUPINFLOW: A struct that is used to specify various windows related properties for a process. It allows us to control windows station, desktop, standard handles and appearance of the main window of the process. 
- PROCESS_INFORMATION: A struct that contain identification information about the process. 
- LRESULT: Type to define the return type of a callback function? Defines as a LONG_PTR.
- CALLBACK: A macro that specifies the calling convention for a function. 

Functions: 
- **CreateToolhelp32Snapshot():** Lets is take a "snapshot" of the processes currently running. Can iterate through this "list" and get a handle to a specific process.  Must combine with other function to complete the iterating. 


Combining datatypes to make "abstract" return types: 
- LRESULT CALLBACK: A function that returns an LRESULT and uses the CALLBACK calling convention. 

Syntax:
- String literal: If we want a string to be treated as a wchar_t, we should prefix the string with an 'L'. Example: `L"C:\\Path\\To\\Application.exe"`
