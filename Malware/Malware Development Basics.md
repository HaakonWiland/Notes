**Windows Processes:**
Instance of a particular executable running. An application can have multiple processes. Think of it as a container for different operations. It is possible to have processes within another process. A process have its own dedicated memory. Processes are independent of each other, and "do not know" that the other processes exist. 

Useful tools:
- Process hacker: Lets us find processes running on the system, easy to search with a PID. 

Different processes:
- Application processes:
- Background processes:
- Windows processes: System level processes, necessary for windows to work as it should. 

Processes can have different priority values: Is basically says how important a specific process is, and in what order it should be executed. Generally 6 levels of priority.

A process has some basic properties associated with it:
- PID: Process identifier.
- Image path: Path to the executable where the process originated.
- Threads: Always has a main Thread, but can have multiple threads that are splitting up the task at hand. Threads are dependent of each other, and can share memory. 

Processes in C/C++ using Windows API:
- Creating: CreateProcessW()
- Opening: OpenProcess()

Q: Do we need admin access to run a program that starts processes? 


**Handles:**
Works as an access point to a process, we often use handles as arguments to interact with a process. 


**Shellcode:**
Why use shellcode when we can just make a function that executes what we want? -> Shellcode makes it easier for us to hide the payload from antivirus software. Good way to get shellcode is using metasploit in KALI.

**Fileless attacks:**
To avoid malware detection software we prefer to inject the payload into memory of the system, instead of injecting to disk.

**Injection attacks:**
When injecting the payload we usually follow 3 steps:
1. Allocate memory: VirtualAlloc()
2. Write shellcode to allocated memory: RtlCopyMemory()
3. Execute shellcode 

We can either create a process and inject the payload into this process (**Self-injection**), or we can inject the payload into an already existing process (**Process injection**). In process injection we often want to use the **handle** of the process that we want to inject.
