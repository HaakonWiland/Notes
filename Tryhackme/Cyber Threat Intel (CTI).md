#### Tools for CTI:
- URLscan: https://urlscan.io/ - Analyze of url 
- Abuse: https://abuse.ch/ - Hub for different tools which help identify and track malware and botnets. (Malware Bazarr, Feodo Tracker, Treat Fox and more)
- Phishtool: https://www.phishtool.com/ - Analyzing potential phishing emails. 
Random tip: it is possible to save the source code of an email, paste it into a .txt file and upload it to phishtool.
- Virustotal: https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload
Random tip: Checking the hash of zip'ed file and the unzid'ed file gives different results.
