#### Stages of the treat hunting process 
**Setting the Sage:** 
- Planning and preparation
- get an understanding of the treat landscape, 
- the business critical requirement
- configuring tools(SIEM, IDS, EDR)

**Formulating Hypotheses:**
- Educated prediction to guide our treat hunting. Base on resent threat intelligence, industry updates, alerts from security tools.
- Make the hypotheses testable 

**Designing the hunt:**
- Develop the hunting strategy based on the hypotheses 
- Look in relevant data sources (logs)
- Sorting out methodologies and tools we are going to use 
- Defining IOCs and patters we are going to hunt for
- Develop custom scripts for hunting based on our hypothesis 

**Data gathering and examination:**
- Active threat hunting starts 
- Collect log files, network traffic, endpoint data etc.
- Analyze the data we collected 
- Goal is to find evidence that could support or falsify out hypothesis 

**Evaluating findings and test hypothesis:**
- What hypothesis hold and which hypothesis did we falsify 
- Understand the treats we detected 
- Identify affected systems 
- Determine the potential impact of the threats 

**Mitigating threats:**
- For the confirmed threats, undertake remediation actions 
- Isolating affected systems 
- Eliminating malware 
- Patching vulnerabilities 
- Modifying configurations 

**After the hunt:**
- Document and share findings, methods and outcomes 
- Enhancing detection rules 
- Refine incident response playbook
- Improve security policies 

**Continuous learning and enhancement:**
- Learn for the process
