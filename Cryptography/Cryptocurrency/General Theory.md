### Different ways of validating transactions:

**Proof of Work (PoW):**
- **Def:** Participants needs to solve complex mathematical problems to validate transactions and create new blocks. 
- **Security:** High security due to the computational power required to solve the puzzles and to alter the blockchain.
- **Energy consumption:** Very energy intensive as it requires significant computational power. 
- **Decentralization:** Anyone with the necessary computational power can participate 
- **Scalability:**  Limited, cause of the high energy consumption.


**Proof of Stake (PoS):**
- **Def:** Consensus mechanism where validators are chosen to create new blocks based on the number of coins they hold and are willing to "stake" as collateral. 

How it works:
- **Staking:** Participants lock up certain amount of their cryptocurrency as a stake. The stake acts as a deposit that incentivizes consensus process. The more coins staked, and the longer someone have been staking, the higher the chance to be chosen as a validator. Stakers can also participate in voting such as: Protocol upgrade, changes on network parameters, etc. 
- **Validator Selection:** Validators are chosen to create new blocks based on the amount of cryptocurrency they have staked and, in some cases, additional factors like a the of the stake. 
- **Reward:** Validators receive transaction fees and in some cases additional cryptocurrency as reward. 

- **Security:** Dependent on the distribution of stakes.
- **Energy consumption:** More energy-efficient than PoW as it does not require extensive computational power. 
- **Decentralization:** Can be decentralized, but there is in some cases a risk of CENTRALIZATION if a small number of participants hold a large percentage of the total stake. 
- **Scalability:** Generally more scalable than PoW due to lower energy requirements. 

Benefits:
- Can gain interest from staking.
