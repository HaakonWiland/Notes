**Time Complexity:** O(V+E)
**Application:** Iterating over a graph, often used as building blocks for other functionalities such as: Counting connected components, Determine connectivity, Topological ordering etc..
**Other:** DFS has same properties as BFS, but has for some problems one is better then the other. 
**Difference between BFS:** Stack based and uses less memory. Better at solving maze-type-problems
