A class of Algorithms. 

Example Algorithms:
- Prims Algorithm 
- Kruskal's Algorithm 
- Huffman / Huffman Codes 


Common problems which can be solved with Greedy Algorithms:
- Different Interval Scheduling problem.
- Shortest Path Problem -> Solved by Dijkstra's algorithm 
- Minimum Spanning Tree Problem.
