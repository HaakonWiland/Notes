**Works on data structure:** Tree 
**Application:** Search algorithm used to explore nodes and edges in a graph. Especially finding the shortest path in an undirected graph. Applying BFS to a graph lets up visit all the nodes reachable from the start node. 
**Time Complexity:** O(V+E) if the graph is connected?
