A class of problems, where the problem cannot be solved efficiently. 

Lingo and definitions:
- Tractable: Problems that can be solved in polynomial time.
- Intractable problems: Problems not solvable in polynomial time, often in the category of NP-hard or NP-Complete. 

Key concepts:
- Difference between: P, NP, NP-Complete and NP-Hard -> Prove such properties

**Complexity Classes:**
- **P:** Problems solvable in polynomial time.
- **NP(Nondeterministic Polynomial time):** Problems for which a given solution can be **verified** in polynomial time.  
- **NP-Complete:** Subset of NP problems, that are at least as hard as any other problem in NP.
- **NP-Hard:** Problems that are at least as hard as the hardest problems in NP, but NOT necessarily in NP. 


Common problems: 
- Traveling Salesman Problem
- Hamiltonian Cycle Problem 
- Satisfiability Problem
